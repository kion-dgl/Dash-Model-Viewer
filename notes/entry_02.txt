Yesterday I was able to get a few basic models exported with all primitives in-
tact with embedded textures. So the next step is to start applying bones. After
looking over the gltf format it looks like there are a few additions I need to 
make to the exports.

First it looks like gltf refers to "bones" as "joints", and then each joint is
defined as a node. On the node that defines the mesh, will need to include a 
"skin" attribute which points to a definition where all of the joint-nodes are
defined in an array. The mesh will then need to define two more attributes, 
one being the joint, and the second being the weight. In our case, since 
multiple bones probably don't affact the same primitives, we'll only be using
a weight of 1.0f for all of them. 

And then the last thing that worries me is the inverse bind matrices in the skin
definition of gltf. I'm not exactly sure what it does or why I need it. The bone
structure for Megaman Legends is such that there is only translation and one
weight per primitive. So we can try leaving that out and see if we can get by 
without it, otherwise, hopefully it won't be too hard to calculate.

As for approach we have the orudakoitan, and chest which each have only two 
primitives. Specifically the orudakoitan has no animations, so we can be sure 
that there is no other information required. So that seems like the best place
to start. Following that we have the hokkoro which has four feet, which should
also be pretty simple to start with.
