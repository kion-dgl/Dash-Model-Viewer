When getting started this morning I was unexpectedly able to get the hierarchy 
for models working. In Megaman Legeneds primitives only have one bone or joint. 
Initially that bone only has translation. And each bone (aside from bone 0), 
has a parent from which is inheriets translation.

So basically all I had to do was add the x,y,z translations of the parent bone,
and then add each of these values to the vertices in their respective primitives
to get a tpose for the model.

In terms of methodology, I'm transforming the verices in my program rather than
using the gltf file format. The problem that I ran into was that gltf expects 
four vertex weights as a vec4 format, when I'm only dealing with one weight.
So I need to look into the format more in order to utilize it. 

That aside, I'm pretty happy with the results for now, as the export format can
be modified and changed. The next issue I need to work on is finding the x and
y image buffer coordinates for the model being used. That should allow me to 
test other files.
